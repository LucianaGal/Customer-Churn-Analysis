# Customer Churn Analysis

This project uses Tableau to visualize and analyze the key factors contributing to customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal is to uncover patterns that explain why customers leave and provide insights to improve retention strategies.

## Included Files

- `analyzing-customer-churn.twbx` – Interactive dashboard created with Tableau.
- `Screenshots` – Dashboard preview.

## Analysis Objectives

- Identify the main causes of customer churn.
- Analyze the distribution of customers by subscribed services.
- Evaluate the relationship between contract duration and churn.
- Visualize customer segments with higher churn risk.

## Tools Used

- Tableau
- Simulated churn dataset (possibly based on IBM or Kaggle)
- Exploratory data analysis and interactive visualizations

## Key Insights

- Customers with monthly contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Fiber internet users tend to churn more than DSL users.
- Customers with no dependents or electronic billing are more likely to leave.
- Senior citizens show slightly higher churn behavior.
- Subscribing to multiple services (e.g., tech support, streaming) can either increase or decrease churn depending on combination.

## Actions to Be Taken

Based on the churn analysis insights, the following actions are recommended to reduce customer attrition:

- **Promote Long-Term Contracts**  
  Encourage customers to switch from monthly to annual contracts by offering discounts, perks, or bundled services.

- **Improve Fiber Internet Experience**  
  Investigate the reasons behind higher churn in fiber internet users and enhance customer service or performance where needed.

- **Target At-Risk Segments**  
  Design retention campaigns focused on high-risk groups:
  - Customers without dependents  
  - Senior citizens  
  - Users enrolled in electronic billing

- **Encourage Bundled Services**  
  Promote multi-service packages that provide added value and reduce churn likelihood.

- **Deploy Personalized Retention Campaigns**  
  Use churn risk segmentation to offer tailored discounts or proactive support before customers leave.

- **Monitor and Engage Based on Usage**  
  Track service usage patterns to detect early signs of disengagement and trigger timely outreach.
